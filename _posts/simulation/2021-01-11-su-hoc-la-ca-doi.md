## Overview
In this example we intend to perform thermal analysis of a tea pot and indicate the temperature distribution in a steady state and transient analysis for steel material and for porcelain material.

## Goal
To perform steady state and transient thermal analysis for steel and porcelain tea pot.

## Modeling Steps
**3.1.** Open Ansys workbench, create a "Steady State Thermal System" system

**3.2.** Define material property for the parts. Steel and Porcelain are used here just for demonstration purpose, but proper material property should be used.

**3.3.** Import model and suppress half-symmetric portion of the model. After suppressing the half portion, the model will look like as indicated in Figure 1.


## Summary
Summarize the results succinctly and tie them closely with the modeling goals outlined above.
